- click on a user to view list of movies they've rated and the ratings -- done! judgment.py
- create a new user w/ password
	- validate form input: require at least email & password -- done
	- check that email isn't already in database for an existing user
- log in as a user (session) --done
	- create login.html page (form)
	- write login app def:

Old Stuff

different ways to validate login data:
method 1:
	db = get row from db that checks for email and password
	if missing email or missing password or db doesn't exist:
		blah
	else
		you were actually successfuly, log in
method 2:
	if missing email or missing password:
		flash "you're missing an email or a password!"
		return back to login.html page
	else:
		check db for a row that has that email and that password

		if that row exists
			return to index page (login was successful!)

		else:
			return back to login.html page (login was unsuccessful)
