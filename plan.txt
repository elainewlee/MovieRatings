To do:
- view list of all users -- done, user_list.html
- click on a user to view list of movies they've rated and the ratings -- done! judgment.py
- create a new user w/ password
	- validate form input: require at least email & password -- done
- log in as a user (session)

different ways to validate login data:
method 1:

	if missing email or mising password:
			blah
	elif db row doesnt exists:
		blah
	else
		you were actually successfuly, log in
method 2:
	if missing email or missing password:
		flash "you're missing an email or a password!"
		return back to login.html page
	else:
		check db for a row that has that email and that password

		if that row exists
			return to index page (login was successful!)

		else:
			return back to login.html page (login was unsuccessful)
